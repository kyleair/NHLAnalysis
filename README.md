# NHLAnalysis

The Kaggle dataset used can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/professional-hockey-database. I only used the Scoring.csv, AwardsPlayers.csv and Master.csv files for this project.
I worked on this project in some spare time to display elementary data manipulation and visualization skills while exploring a subject I am interested in. I created the Jupyter notebook to display the code I made.
